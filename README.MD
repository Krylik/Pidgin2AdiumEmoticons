### Wat
This utility was built to port Berachs Complete Pidgin emotepack to an AdiumEmoticonSet.

It can be used to port any Pidgin emote pack to an adium one really, but this repo's releases will be built using Berachs pack from https://github.com/Berach/BERACHS_COMPLETE_PIDGIN as a source.

Usage:
```python emoticonpack_builder path_to_pidgin_folder name_of_adium_emoticonset```
